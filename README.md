# Project Name
> Melanoma detection assignment where in we have built a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 


## Table of Contents
* [General Info](#general-information):This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

* [Technologies Used](#technologies-used): Jypiter note book, Python, Tensorflow library, Keras
       

## General Information
The dataset consists of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.

The data set contains the following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion


## Conclusions
Accuracy on training data has increased by using Augmentor library
Model is still overfitting
The problem of overfitting can be solved by add more layer,neurons or adding dropout layers.
The Model can be further improved by tuning the hyperparameter
